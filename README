Overview
========

The Oculus Rift CV1 camera viewer is a simple graphical utility to view
a live video feed from an Oculus Rift CV1 tracking camera. It is a pure
userland application, talking to a camera device through its low-level
USB interface, and does not require any custom kernel modules.

The Oculus Rift CV1 camera viewer is based on the Vrui VR development
toolkit, version 5.2-001 or later. It runs on Linux operating systems.

Installation
============

First, install the Vrui VR development toolkit. It can be downloaded
from http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/Vrui/LinkDownload.html .
The easiest way to install Vrui is to use one of the installation
scripts found on the download page linked above.

Second, open a terminal window and change into the directory containing
this README file. Then run the following commands (the "$" indicates a
terminal prompt and must not be typed in):

$ make

If you installed Vrui into a different location than /usr/local in the
first step, you need to pass Vrui's location to the make command like
so:

$ make VRUI_MAKEDIR=<Vrui install directory>/share/make

where <Vrui install directory> is Vrui's installation directory, e.g.,
/opt/Vrui-5.2 .

Use
===

Installation creates a "bin" directory inside the directory containing
this README file, which contains a single executable,
"OculusRiftCV1CameraViewer." To run the program, open a terminal window,
change into the directory containing this README file, and run:

$ sudo ./bin/OculusRiftCV1CameraViewer

The viewer application requires using "sudo" to access the camera's low-
level USB device. This can be avoided by granting the current console
user access to the device through a udev rule, see below.

This will open a window showing a live feed from the first connected
Oculus Rift CV1 tracking camera. You can pan the image by holding the
"z" key and moving the mouse, and zoom the image either by holding the
left mouse button and the "z" key and moving the mouse up or down, or by
rolling the mouse wheel. You can reset the view by holding the "Windows"
key and pressing the "Home" key. You can exit from the program by
pressing the "Esc" key, or by closing the window.

The program understands optional command line arguments:

$ sudo ./bin/OculusRiftCV1CameraViewer [<camera index>] [-auto]
        [-gain <gain>] [-exposure <exposure>]

[<camera index>]: Zero-based index of the camera from which to capture
        video.

[-auto]: Enable automatic exposure and gain control.

[-gain <gain>]: Specify a global gain factor between 0 and 255

[-exposure <exposure>]: Specify an exposure time in multiples of pixel
        rows. Exposure time can be longer than the height of a video
        frame (960), which will increase brightness at the cost of frame
        rate. In IR-dark environments, high exposure times (>10000)
        might be necessary.

Example command line:

$ sudo ./bin/OculusRiftCV1CameraViewer 1 -gain 128 -exposure 800

will stream video from the second connected camera, using a global gain
of 128 and an exposure time of 800 lines.

Creating a udev rule
====================

To grant the current console user, i.e., the user currently logged in to
the desktop session, access to the camera's USB device, create a udev
rule by creating a new file, "69-OculusRift.rules", in the udev rules
directory, typically "/etc/udev/rules.d". From a terminal, run

$ sudo cat > /etc/udev/rules.d/69-OculusRift.rules

and then enter exactly the following text into the terminal window:

# Rule for Oculus Rift CV1 head-mounted display and tracking camera
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2833", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0031", TAG+="uaccess"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2833", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0211", TAG+="uaccess"

When finished, press Ctrl+d to close the newly-created file. Check the
file's contents by running

$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/69-OculusRift.rules

and comparing the response to the text above. It must match exactly.

Then unplug and re-plug all Oculus Rift CV1 tracking cameras, and run
the OculusRiftCV1CameraViewer program without sudo.
